  <p><strong>About Me</strong>
  <br><br>
  Hello! I'm Tolulope Ladele, an aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in data visualization, statistical analysis, and data-driven decision-making. With expertise in Azure, Power BI, Tableau, Python, and R, I am well-equipped to turn complex data into actionable insights.
  I recently graduated with a degree in Data Science, where I developed a passion for uncovering patterns and trends in data. During my studies, I completed several projects that allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. For example, I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI that visualized sales data for a local business, helping them identify key areas for growth and efficiency improvements.
  <p><strong>My technical skills include: </strong>
  Azure, Power BI & Tableau, Python & R, Machine learning
